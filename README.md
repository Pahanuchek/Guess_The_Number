# The essence of the program is to guess the number

## After launching, you need to enter a name, and select "YES" to start the game, or "NO" to exit.

If you enter YES, the game will prompt you to guess a number from 1 to 10.
If you enter NO, the program will exit.
If you guessed right, the program will congratulate you, if not, it will console you.
But in any case, he will offer you to play again, or exit.
